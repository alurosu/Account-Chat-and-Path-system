# mmo
I am testing my programming skills in creating a game (at least that's what I hope it will be when it's finished). Everything is coded from scrath. The only framework I used so far is jQuery.

A lot of scripts and stylings you find here can be used for different purposes. You can use any piece of code from this project as long as you give me a reference.
## Implemented features
- account: login, register
- loading: chat, profile, map
- chat: send, receive, empty db
- profile: load stats, add/remove hp, add/remove energy, add xp
- map: create, draw
